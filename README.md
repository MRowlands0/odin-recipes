This project is to create a basic HTML only website that will embed my knowledge of some basic HTML; boilerplate, links, proper setup and images. Once completed, I should be able to create the basic boilerplate structure for a HTML file and create links to different pages and include images within the pages. 

Thoughts after completing the project.
